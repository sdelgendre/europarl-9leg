This repository provides data on voting results about the ninth European Parliament.

Each row represents a specific vote and MEPs' individual positions.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE** : MEPs are identified with both their name and political group at voting time. MEPs can therefore be associated with multiple columns if there is a change in their group name (e.g. GUE/NGL â†’ The Left) or if they've moved to another groups.
